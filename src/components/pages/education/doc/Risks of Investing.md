# Risks of Investing

Investing in any company, including a Startup (also called Issuer), listed on the BRITE crowdfunding platform carries high risk. Every Funder or Investor should be aware of the risks regardless of the assurances given by the Issuer.

There can be no guarantee as to the:

- Validation or reliability of the information or projection made by the Issuer on the BRITE platform
- Actual accomplishment of business goals by the Issuer
- Investors earning a material return on any part of the investment made by them

It's crucial to take note of these risks (among any others) and to carefully evaluate them before choosing to make an investment in any Company, Startup, or Issuer through the offerings made on BRITE crowdfunding platform.

### Risk of Illiquidity

**Restriction on resale or transfer of securities offered, absence of secondary market**

All investments made by an Investor will be private and illiquid holdings. There is no readily available mechanism for the liquidity for any investments made by the Investor. There are also no public markets made available for selling the securities, which are in control of the Investor.

Currently, there is no methodology in place for public exchange of these securities (such as New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ) for the trade of shares purchased through equity crowdfunding on BRITE.

Except under certain conditions, the securities issued in transactions that are in accordance to Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act may not be transferred by the purchaser of any such securities for a period of one-year, after the issue of such securities.

You may not be able to liquidate your investments because of the lack of an established secondary market in these securities. In essence, you may have to hold on to your investments until the company you invested in completes an IPO, gets acquired, or merges with another to realize some sort of material gain.

It is possible that such an event never occurs, and if something of this nature does occur, it is possible for you to lose your entire investment.

Investors should discuss the risks and opportunities of investing in new ventures, startups, and private companies on BRITE with their financial advisor to determine whether it is a reasonable course of action for them.

### Risk of Speculative Investment

**Startup Investments: High-Risk Long-Term commitment, loss of investment**

There is high risk involved in Startup investments because these ventures are up against significant operating and financial risks. It is possible that the targeted or projected returns may never actually materialize.

It is also possible that there may not be enough funds to adequately compensate an Investor for the risks taken by them. It is possible for an Investor to lose their entire investment in Startups because the speculative character of these companies.

There is only a small percentage of businesses in the Startup world that are able to survive and prosper. Unexpected problems in various fields of manufacturing, product development, financing, marketing, and general management, among other similar areas are experienced by Startups that are often not readily solvable.

In addition, many Issuers may find themselves in requirement of additional funding which is not easily available through public markets or even private placements.

Investment in small companies is speculative, especially when they are in the startup or the early stage.

While, in general sense, the amount invested should provide returns in accordance with projected or promised figures, the same is not always realized. Also, it is possible that even when returns are realized, they may not be adequate to cover the risks taken by an Investor.

The timing of the promised return on the investment is also highly speculative.

Potential Investors must understand that it is their sole responsibility to determine their own suitability while making an investment via BRITE platform. Investors must recognize and accept the risks involved with making such choices, which includes a significant risk of losing the entire principal invested. Investors should be prepared and be able to afford the loss of their entire investment.

BRITE has no fiduciary duty or special relationship with any potential Investors and no such relationship is created by virtue of the Investor's use of the Site.

Potential Investors should be aware of their responsibility towards conducting their own accounting, legal, and other due diligence and reviews of any investment opportunity which is made available on the Site.

### Risk of Cancellation Restrictions

Investors have a right to cancel any investment commitment prior to the deadline mentioned in the Issuer's offering documents as posted on the BRITE platform, but only up until forty-eight hours (48 hours). BRITE will automatically notify all Investors on its website as soon as the target offering amount has been achieved.

An Issuer may decide to close the offering early if it reaches its target offering amount as identified in the offering materials, prior to the deadline, provided it furnishes the deadline of the new offering, at least five business day (5 business days) prior to the actual offering.

The BRITE platform may continue accepting all investment commitments during this stipulated 5-day window period.

The fund shall be deemed released to the Issuer by the escrow agent used upon the closing of offering, if an Investor misses out on canceling the investment commitment 48 hours prior to the offering deadline.

In such case, the Investor will be granted securities in exchange for their investment amount. BRITE shall direct the return of all funds committed by the Investor during the offering, in the event an investment commitment stands canceled.

### Risk of Lack of Information for Company/Startup Valuation & Capitalization

It is possible that your crowdfunding investment on BRITE results in the purchase of an equity stake in some startup. While listed companies are valued publicly with market-driven stock prices, the process of valuable becomes challenging in the case of private companies, particularly Startups.

In such a scenario, you are at a considerable risk of overpaying for your equity stake. On top of this, there is also the risk of attaining sub-par class of equity through crowdfunding, while the superior ones with various rights are offered through other market mechanisms.

Investors may also be unable to obtain all information required on a timely basis regarding a particular Startup.

They may not be made aware of any major adverse changes in the business in a timely manner. In summary, an Investor may not be in a position to obtain accurate information about the current valuation of the Startup because of these limitations.

### Risk of Limited Disclosure Requirements for Companies and Ventures

When companies make use of Regulation Crowdfunding to attract capital, they have to make certain disclosures pertaining to the management, subscription details, business plan, and use of proceeds. Most early stage companies have limited disclosure requirements since they lack operating history.

Early-stage companies don't have a long or established history of operations or a fully developed business to provide more disclosure and may only be able to furnish limited data points with regard to their work and business plans. You may not get access to a detailed disclosure and may only receive limited or inadequate disclosures for your crowdfunding investment.

Regulation Crowdfunding offerings under $535,000.00 don't require audited financial statements. The company is not required to furnish quarterly unaudited financial statements or annual audited financial statements, except in certain situations.

It is possible for the Issuer to not have its financial statement reviewed by outside auditors. Your decision to make the investment may have to be based exclusively on the information furnished by the Issuer in its offering materials.

It is important to note that this information may not be complete or represent the actual financial condition of the business.

### Risk of Investment in Personnel

Risk related to the quality of management or entrepreneurial talent is also a part of the early-stage investments. The ability to execute on the proposed business plan is vital to the viability and success of any business.

You should be aware that a startup or a new company's management and employees may be funded through your investments. Make sure you carefully review all disclosures regarding the use of proceeds before investing.

Venture Capital (VC) or Angel Investors often provide more than just basic funding where Startups are concerned. These entities bring deep domain knowledge, expertise, resources, and important contacts to the Startup, which brings the business closer to success.

However, a seed-stage company that chooses the route of crowdfunding via BRITE is not likely to have partnered with Angel Investors or VCs. Therefore, they are likely to have little or no access to critical professional guidance. It's fundamental to remember that human resource constitutes one of the most neglected elements of Startup businesses in general.

### Risk of Crowdfunding Scams and Fraud

In light of the online process for early-stage companies to raise their funds through crowdfunding, it may be possible for certain investment opportunities to turn out nothing more than money-losing fraudulent schemes.

As with any other investment, crowdfunding investments don't come with a guarantee that the investment shall be immune to fraud.

Potential for fraud increases significantly as crowdfunding is gradually taking a more mainstream role. It seems that each day brings with it fresh stories of scams and frauds occurring in the crowdfunding space. Advancing technologies have also enabled fraudsters with novel tricks to hide their identities and swindle gullible investors.

### Possibility of Share Dilution

Investments made through equity crowdfunding are subject to future dilution of shares. This happens when a company begins a fresh round of issuing equity shares. Every existing shareholder who does not take part in the issue of new shares is affected by this dilution.

As a result, the proportionate shareholding of the individual investor in the company is diluted or reduced. This can impact multiple aspects of their investment, including dividends, share value, and voting.

Some businesses offering Seed Shares through equity crowdfunding might protect Investors from dilutions by offering pre-emption rights.  In this scenario, a business shall have to give the first opportunity of buying new shares issued in subsequent fundraising to the shareholders with Seed Shares.

This is done in a bid to preserve or maintain the shareholding. If you are buying shares with pre-emption rights, then research the crowdfunding pitch and Articles of the Company thoroughly before investing.

### Challenges of Annual Filings with SEC

Issuers selling securities in a Regulation Crowdfunding offering are required to furnish an annual report on Form C-AR within 120 days from the last date of the fiscal year. The report must be posted on the Issuer's website and filed on EDGAR.

Issuers are required to file notice on Form C-TR if they want to terminate their annual reporting obligations. This form reports that the Issuers will not provide annual reports pursuant to the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding.

### Risk of Very Limited or No Revenue Generation

**no dividend payouts or profit sharing**

The biggest risk in crowdfunding is to lose the investment in its entirety because a lot of businesses in the early stage are at a risk of completely failing or barely surviving with zero profits and growth. It is clearly probable that you may lose your investment fully or partly in such a case.

There is no guarantee that you will achieve a meaningful return on your investment or at least receive the initial amount back, even if the company becomes profitable. Loss of investment can be attributed to business-related and general risks.

Business related risks include industry risk, market demand risk, competition risk, employee risk, growth risk, revenue risk, and fraud risk. General risk includes political risks, geographical risk, economic risk, and legislative risk. Keep in mind that these are just some of the omnipresent risks.

It is impossible to predict which startup could be finally successful in delivering you a return on your investment in a satisfactory manner.

### Risk of Legal Disputes and Regulatory Risks Associated with Crowdfunding

There is no assurance before, during, or after the offering that Issuers may comply with federal law mandated requirements that permit private firms to raise finances from retail investors through Regulation Crowdfunding portal, like BRITE.

Most new ventures involve the efforts of more than one person. It is important for a founder's agreement to clarify the ownership of each member and their respective duties towards the organization from the very outset.

Startup management should be aware of all the required licenses and permits needed to function without trouble. There can be serious legal ramifications due to non-compliance of regulations. An organization may have to pay hefty monetary penalties leading to financial losses.

Ignorance of relevant tax laws is one of the most potent legal risks faced by Startups. Applicable taxes must be known to new enterprises along with all the relevant forms and returns that need to be filed in their jurisdiction.

Periodically, a Startup may be subject to various regulatory and legal actions relating to current and past company business operations. These include, but are not limited to following disputes:

- employee actions
- products and services
- sales disclosure, practices, licensing, compensation arrangements, and regulatory compliance
- tax liabilities with taxing authorities
- administrative or governmental investigations in the context of regulated activity sectors

Outcome of these investigations or lawsuits cannot be predicted by the company. Also, the company cannot guarantee that the proceeding shall not materially affect the company negatively.

### Risks Associated with Changes in Economic Conditions, Laws, and Technology

General economic conditions determine the success of all investment activities. Fluctuating conditions in the equity markets, external credit markets, and other economic systems on which the Issuer may depend are likely to have a significant impact on the Issuer's objectives, profitability, and operations.

Sustainability and stability of business growth in a global marketplace may also be influenced by acts of war, terrorism, and other unpredictable events.

There is no assurance as to the presence of favorable economic systems or markets as needed or anticipated for the Issuer to succeed in its business venture.

The Investor's investment value in Startups may be dependent on multiple uncontrollable factors affecting the industry and risks pertaining to the investment product. Following are some of the specific risks experienced by Startups:

- changing technologies
- changing consumer preferences
- scarcity of technical, research, scientific, marketing, and management personnel with requisite skills and training
- probability of lawsuits related to intellectual property or patent infringement
- rapidly deteriorating investor sentiments regarding risky technology sector investments
- changes in government policies affecting the startups or delays in securing regulatory approvals

### Uncertainty of a Company's Financial Planning and Forecasts

Current expectations and assumptions laid out by a Startup's management regarding the economy, internal business performance and market dealings, future conditions, and other forecasts related to anticipated circumstances, events, and results, forms the basis for the forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements by a Startup, as with any other forecast or projection are inherently susceptible to changes in circumstances and other uncertainties.

It is probable for a Startup's actual results to vary considerably in material terms as compared to the ones expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.

Some key factors that could cause the actual results delivered by a Startup's performance to diverge considerably in material terms from those implied in the forward-looking statements include macro-economic situation, geo-political events, strategic changes, social implications, and government regulations.

In specific terms, these uncertain factors may include:

- changes (recent or future) made to technology, standards, and services
- changes in consumer expectations and behavior
- changes in the plans, initiatives, or strategies of the Startup and lack of consumer acceptance thereof
- changes in the plans, initiatives, or strategies of third parties which are inherently vital to the Startup's success
- series of competitive changes and undue pressure because of advances in technology
- Startup's ability or inability to keep up with economic slowdown and other market or economic difficulties
- decreased liquidity or increased volatility in capital markets, including limitations imposed on the Startup's ability to access capital markets for obtaining equity, bank financings, or debt, refinancing outstanding indebtedness, and for debt securities, on acceptable terms
- failing to meet expected earnings
- whether the Startup's risk management framework is adequate
- changes in applicable accounting policies, including GAAP
- impact of external events, such as hostilities, terrorist acts, pandemic viruses, extreme weather, and natural disaster
- failure or disruption of the information and network systems, including any other technology of the Startup or the vendors, upon which the business relies
- changes in federal communication, tax laws, or any other laws and regulations
- changes in the stability and existence of foreign exchange rates or currencies
- ther uncertainties and risks which may or may not be discussed specifically in materials provided to Investors

Any forward-looking statement by the Startup does not really look further than the current date on which it is made.

Additionally, Startups are not under any obligation to or expressly disclaim their obligation to alter and update the forward-looking statement, regardless of any new data or information made available, occurrence of subsequent events, or otherwise.

These foregoing risks are not purported to be a complete and thorough explanation of all the risks involved in investing in equity and debt securities where a Startup is concerned. Each Investor is encouraged to seek their independent tax and legal advice.

They are also urged to read all investment documents carefully before determining whether they want to invest through the BRITE crowdfunding platform in a Startup or not.

### Lack of Implementing Adequate Accounting Systems, Financial Controls and Procedures

There is a competitive edge provided by internal accounting procedures and financial controls when Investors seek funds.

By implementing a series of checks and balances, the maturity of a company is showcased which can go a long way in hedging the risk to protect the firm's reputation.

Investors acquire reasonable assurance about a company's capabilities to achieve their reported financial objectives with the implementation of internal controls.

Professional accounting and effective financial controls are often overlooked by many Startups and small companies which lack the basic accounting infrastructure and experience. This can lead to frauds, financial losses, and even bankruptcy.

### Uncertainties of Future Funding Rounds for Raising Additional Capital

Issuer's may require additional financing to ensure continuous product and market development and promotion and advertising of the products and services on offer, or to address legal, administrative, and regulatory needs among others – even after an Investor has invested a substantial amount in the company initially. Most Issuers stagger various stages of investment to cover their substantial future capital needs.

However, there is a definite risk of additional financing not becoming available on favorable terms, if at all to a Startup.

The prospects of a Startup to continue as a high growth company are likely to go down rapidly if the company is unsuccessful in raising additional capital after the Series A of funding. It is very rare for financial turnarounds to occur in the venture capital world.

Startups are generally seen in binary terms (hits and failures) by venture capitalists. There are thousands of new businesses that lack the capability to create scalable or repeatable business models due to a failure to secure a second round of funding.

Competition is fierce for every round for capital. Hence, if the previous Investors fail to follow-up with their investments, then the whole future of the company is at risk.

### Lack of Issuer's Financial Audits by Qualified Third Parties

Regulation Crowdfunding offerings under $535,000.00 do not require audited financial statements. It is not unlikely for an Issuer to not even get their financial statements reviewed by outside auditors or have the statements audited.

The decision to make an investment in the Issuer shall be based completely upon the information provided by the Issuer in its offering materials. These materials may not always accurately or completely represent the current financial situation of the company.

There can be no guarantee as to the material weaknesses and deficiencies of the disclosure and financial controls and procedures of the Issuer when there is a lack of third-party audit.

### Taxation and Accounting Implications

Issuers do not guarantee achievement of tax results, and it is not always possible for the investment structure to be tax efficient for the Investor. On top of this, Investors may be imposed with tax reporting requirements under the tax jurisdiction laws which cover Investors.

It is important for Investors to consult with their professional advisers regarding any and all tax consequences of an investment made by them in an Issuer under the laws of the jurisdiction under which the Issuer and the Investors are liable for taxation.

### Minority Investments and Lack of Investor Control

Minority stakes held in privately owned companies are represented as a significant portion of any Investor's investments.

It is possible that the shares are non-voting. However, even if the Investor's shares in the Issuer happen to be voting shares, the Investor may not have control characteristics or valuation premiums accorded to controlling or majority stakes, as is usually the case with minority holdings.

Investors will have to rely on the existing management and board of directors of the company. These may include such representatives of other financial investors who are not affiliated with the Investor and whose interest may be conflicting with the interests of the Investor.

### Diverse Investor Portfolios

Employees and Investors in an Issuer may also have conflict of interest in terms of investment and tax, among others regarding ownership, which may surface with the timing of a sale, structuring of the company, or other similar factors.

As a result, decisions made by the management on such matters may prove to be more useful or beneficial to few Investors, rather than the whole group. Investors should understand that management of a company do not consider the circumstances of any one Investor singularly, but take into account the investment and tax objective of the entire stakeholder group while making decisions on the timing of sale or investment structure.

### Successful Completion of Offering and Relationship between Issuer and BRITE

Investors making an offering on the BRITE platform should understand that once their participation in the offering is complete, and the Issuer has transferred the securities to the Investor, then an ongoing relationship may or may not exist between BRITE and the Issuer.

Any questions and concerns should be forwarded directly to the Issuer in relation to the Issuer's securities or continued disclosures furnished in the Issuer's annual reports on Form C-AR, once the offering through BRITE is complete.

There is no liability or responsibility assumed by BRITE directly or indirectly, for any type of loss or damage caused (or alleged to be caused) by, or as a result of reliance on or related to the use of services provided or disclosures made by the Issuer, once the offering by the Issuer on the BRITE site is complete.

### Use of Funds Raised is Subject to Company Discretion

Companies that are crowdfunded are under an obligation to provide details of the manner in which their proceeds shall be raised and used. However, the company management typically enjoys a considerable amount of flexibility on this account.

It is possible for the company to have the discretion to secretly re-allocate funds as they see fit, as long as it is carried out as per the subscription agreement, without actionable accountability.

The Issuer's directors, founders, and executive officers may be able to exert significant control over the Issuer's affairs and dealings on account of being among the largest stakeholders.

They may in fact have potential interests that diverge from the combined interests of other Investors. This may become worse as time passes and the holdings of directors and other executive officers increase upon maturation of exercise rights under options of warrants held by them, or upon vesting.

In addition, these persons, apart from holding board seats and offices, may also have significant influence and control over corporate actions which ordinarily may require shareholder approval. These actions may significantly differ from the actions taken by the Issuer's other stakeholders, including Investors.

### Lack of Professional Management and Guidance

Issuer's management may be inexperienced about the market realities or even lack in professional expertise. They may not always be able to execute on the business plan due to shortage of skills or experience.

The Investor may not always be able to evaluate the true management capabilities of a company.

As a result, it may become difficult to compete against larger, more established corporations who are in the position to hire top talent as well as engage the services of global consultants and professionals. This type of professional guidance may be unaffordable for a new or small company.

### Intellectual Property Risks

**Copyright pirates, patent flouters, brand impersonators, trade secret thieves**

When it comes to IP and businesses, there are many young companies that fail to comprehend the importance of their IP assets. There are numerous persistent errors that are wholly avoidable, which hamper the capital raising process of a startup and the operations beyond.

Startups cannot benefit from protecting their trade secrets unless they can take specific measures for the same. This usually requires both technical and physical measures in the United States to protect invaluable IP capital. Businesses based out of the US are anyway allowed to eliminate foreign patent rights as long as there is public disclosure.

It is often fatal to Startups to fail to develop a well-thought out IP protection strategy. This risk is immensely high for Startups in the technological sector.

### Limited Voting Rights

It is very rare for investments made on BRITE to include voting rights for smaller investors. This is because the founders are often worried about the future possibility of scaring off angel investors or venture capitalists who may want to invest in later rounds.

Issuers are also concerned with the hassle of attaining multiple signatures (votes) before making a major decision. It is better to assume that your investment on BRITE may not come with voting rights, unless otherwise specified.

### Risks Associated with Each Type of Security Being Offered on BRITE Platform

#### _Equity (common stock, preferred stock)_

Equity investments are subject to market risks. If you think you are cannot afford to lose 100 percent of the principal amount you invested on BRITE in equities, then you should avoid investing in this type of security. Similarly, if you cannot potentially wait for several years before you start receiving returns on your investment, equity investing via BRITE platform may not be appropriate for you.

You may strongly believe in a company's future success but be aware that equity investments are highly uncertain and fraught with unforeseen risks. They may or may not pay off in the very long term.

Unlike stock markets, there is often a more binary approach to investment outcomes with startups. It is either a great success or a complete failure. This means the risk of losing your entire principal amount is high.

On top of this, you may not be able to re-sell your equity investment in a startup easily on the stock market, unless the company prepares for an IPO or is acquired by a publicly traded company.

#### _Convertible notes_

A Convertible Note is used as an instrument of funding by many early-stage startups.

These notes will convert your investments at a later date if the company enters into a subsequent 'price round' with major investors, who are mostly venture capitalists.

You may become a shareholder owning equity at that point (when your notes get converted into equity). It is also possible that you may earn a return if the stock value goes up over time. However, the operating word here is 'If'.

So, be careful and consider all possible market risks before choosing to invest through BRITE in securities that hold a 'future' promise such as convertible notes.

#### _Debt (promissory note)_

Loans are less risky as compared to equity investments, but they may have a relatively smaller upside. It is possible that even a loan may not be repaid, so make sure you only invest on BRITE by way of debt an amount that you can afford to lose.

Investors receive cash on a quarterly or an annual basis with debt investments. Principal is repaid along with the interest amount. However, you should also take into account the downside to debt, which is that you will miss out on owning an equity stake, if the company turns out to be valuable in the future.

#### _SAFE Agreements_

SAFE grants were first developed by Y Combinator in 2013 to help an investor gain the right to acquire equity in future financing. These agreements have been used by multiple Silicon Valley startups to raise money from angel investors.

However, you should only consider investing in SAFE Agreements through BRITE if you are sure that the startup would be successful in raising financing from large angel investors or venture capitalists in the future.
