### Disclosure Requirements

The SEC elaborates upon its expectations with relation to Issuers and the filing of a detailed description as to the intended use of investment proceeds, with adequate information, to provide a clear understanding to investors about how all offering proceeds will be used.
\
The Issuer, if uncertain about the application of proceeds, should go on to identify all probable uses along with the factors that may influence the selection of each such use.

### Annual Filing Obligation of Issuers

Each Issuer who successfully completes an offering of Title III Regulation Crowdfunding securities is obligated to file Form C-AR with the SEC annually, along with all necessary financial statements.

This filing must be done no later than after 120 days from the end of the Issuer's fiscal year which covered such filing. Each Issuer is also required to post its Form C-AR with all necessary financial statements to the Issuer's website, the link of which must be provided along with the date by which such report shall be made available on the said website.

There are updated disclosures in the Form C-AR that are substantially similar to the disclosures provided in the Issuer's initial Form C. This includes information regarding the Issuer's location, size, employees and principal, plan of operation, business, and the risks of investing in the Issuer's securities. However, it is not mandatory for the offering-specific disclosures to be made in the Form C-AR.

It is required by the Issuer to continue filing annual Form C for each fiscal year until one of the following event occurs earlier:

- The Issuer is dissolved as per the stipulations of state law
- The Issuer or any another party purchases the entire securities that were offered in the Title III offering
- The Issuer has successfully filed at least one report annually and has fewer than 300 shareholders on record
- The Issuer has successfully filed three reports annually and has total assets not measuring greater than $10 million.

**Note:** At any point of time, an Issuer's obligation to file the said annual reports may stand terminated in the future due to any changes in the law or otherwise.

**Additional Note:** You should be aware that following the completion of the offering, an ongoing relationship between BRITE and the Issuer may or may not exist.

### Financial Statement Requirements

The kinds of financial statement as provided by an Issuer depend on three conditions:

1. The amount of money the Issuer is attempting to raise in the current offering;
2. Whether the Issuer is using Title III to make the first offering; and
3. In the event this is not the first offering made by the Issuer using Title III, then the amount raised by the Issuer during the past 12 months using other Title III offerings.

___Where the amount of the offering using Title III, together with all other similar Title III offerings made by the same Issuer within the past 12 months, happen to be:___ $107,000 or less.

The Issuer must furnish: The Issuer's total tax income, total tax amount, and total income, as reported by the Issuer on its Federal tax return, and certified by the Issuer's principal executive officer. The Issuer must provide those financial statements that have been audited or reviewed by a public accountant independent of the Issuer instead, if such documents exist.

___Where the amount of the offering using Title III, together with all other similar Title III offerings made by the same Issuer within the past 12 months, happen to be:___ More than $107,000, but less than $535,000.

The Issuer must furnish: Those financial statements which have been reviewed by any public accountant, independent of the Issuer. However, in the event that there exist financial statements which are audited by a public accountant independent of the Issuer, then such statements must be provided instead.

___Where the amount of the offering using Title III, together with all other similar Title III offerings made by the same Issuer within the past 12 months, happen to be:___ More than $535,000.

The Issuer must furnish: Financial statements reviewed by a public accountant independent of the Issuer, if this is the first offering under Title III made by the Issuer, unless there are financial statements audited by a public accountant independent of the Issuer, in which case, these must be made available.

Financial statements that are audited by a public accountant independent of the Issuer must be made available, in the event the offering is not the first one made by the Issuer under Title III.

All financial statements provided shall be prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and all financial statement reviews shall be conducted as per the Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the Accounting and Review Services Committee of the AICPA (The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants).

All financial statement audits conducted by public accountants shall be completed in accordance with either:

- the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or
- auditing standards of the AICPA

It is not mandatory for these financial statements to be reviewed or audited by a certified accountant. However, if there are financial statements available with the Issuer that have either been audited or reviewed by a public accountant independent of the Issuer, then such financial statements must be furnished instead.

### Business Plan

It is also required that the issuer provide a detailed business plan, one which includes, but is not limited to, the details about the products or services planned to be sold, the target market for such products or services, the short biography and detailed identity of the directors and officers of the Issuer, and an explanation detailing the ways the Issuer intends to apply the funds, so raised.

### Limits on Advertising and Promoters

An Issuer may not freely advertise all terms of the Regulation Crowdfunding offering, except through a notice in which the investors are directed towards the intermediary's platform and which includes information no more than the following:

- A statement notifying the potential investors about the Issuer conducting an offering which is pursuant to Regulation Crowdfunding ("Reg CF") of the Securities Act, the name of the intermediary who would be conducting the offering, and a link that directs potential investors towards such intermediary's platform
- All terms of the offering, which refers to the amount of securities on offer, the nature of such securities, the price of each security, and the closing date
- Factual information regarding the Issuer's legal identity and business location, limited to the name of the security's Issuer, contact information (address, phone number, and website address), email address of the Issuer's representative, and a brief description of the business

Issuers must identify itself as the offering Issuer and all persons acting on its behalf must identify their affiliation in all communications made on the intermediary's platform.

Issuers may compensate others for promotions of crowdfunding offerings as per communication channels provided by the intermediary, but only if reasonable steps are taken by the Issuer to ensure the promoter discloses their compensation in each communication.

#### _Who are Promoters?_

A public relations firm or any other third party may be hired by an Issuer to promote the offering in chat rooms. An employee or the Issuer's founder may also render the same services.

In every situation, the promoter must identify themselves on the Platform and disclose their promotional engagement level. Third parties must also make disclosures to being paid for any promotional activities.

### Due Diligence

We will conduct a minimum background and securities enforcement regulatory history check on the Issuer once the Form C information is filed. The same check shall be conducted on each director, officer, or beneficial owner with 20% or more outstanding voting equity securities of the Issuer, as calculated on the voting power.

Form C information shall be reviewed by us, as will the business plan, financial information, and background and securities enforcement check. Under SEC regulations, we are obligated to determine the following aspects:

- Whether there is reasonable basis for believing the Issuer or any its directors, officers, or beneficial owners with 20% or more outstanding voting equity securities of the Issuer, as calculated on the voting power, are subject to disqualification as per the rules laid down by SEC.
- Whether there is reasonable basis for believing the Issuer has established a means to keep accurate records of security holders that would purchase and become such through the Portal. We may rely on the Issuer representatives for record keeping. However, an Issuer shall be deemed to have taken care of this requirement by engaging the services of a registered transfer agent.
- Whether there is reasonable basis for believing the Issuer or the offering made presents a potential for fraud. We would deny access to our Portal if we believe there are concerns about investor protection and are unable to adequately assess the said risk.
- In addition, we would promptly cancel and remove the offering from our platform, and direct return of all funds committed by investors during the offering, if we become aware of any information that raises concerns about potential of fraud or investor protection.

We are obligated to comply with all of these requirements. But, it is of utmost importance to understand that under no circumstances are we required to conclude the Issuers on the Platform to be representing good investment for investors.

In fact, we are obligated to refrain from making our thoughts known on the Issuer and the investment or making comparisons between similar Issuers. The investor needs to make these decisions without our help.

### Disqualification of Issuers

Title III cannot be used when the Issuer or certain other people have been subject to certain disqualifying events during the 10 years prior to making the offering.

These "certain other people" refers to:

- Any or all predecessors of the Issuer
- Any or all directors, general partners, officers, or managers of the Issuer
- Any person owning 20% or more voting power
- A promoter working for the Issuer
- A person paid for soliciting investors
- Any or all directors, general partners, officers, or managers of such a solicitor

The term "certain disqualifying events" refers to a long list of events, which pertains to improper actions made in the securities business. For instance, it may refer to the loss of license of a broker following misconduct, or the conviction of a misdemeanor or a felony in relation to any security transaction. As explained, we will conduct thorough background checks before allowing any Issuer to be listed on our Platform.

### Posting an Offering

Once the access and approval to make an offering has been granted to the Issuer on the Portal, all information included within Form C, business plans, and financial statements, including any other relevant information:

- Will be made available on BRITE, in a manner suitable to allowing a person reasonable access on the platform to download, save or otherwise store such data and information;
- Will be kept publicly available on the Portal for at least 21 days before the sale of securities commences, and before any investment commitments are accepted by us;
- Will continue to remain publicly available on the Portal until the completion or cancellation of the offer and sale of all securities in relations to Regulation Crowdfunding.

Following our approval, the Issuer can go ahead and create an offering on BRITE. When such an offer has been completed, BRITE will push the offering live for pledges.
