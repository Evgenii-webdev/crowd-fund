# Relationships Between BRITE and Issuers

The Issuers are required to pay to be as part of BRITE's crowdfunding platform. The Issuers can pay in the form of a flat fee, commission on the funds raised, or in other ways.

They may also pay to BRITE for any specified services the platform provides to them and as a reimbursement for any expenses the platform may incur on their behalf. BRITE will disclose the compensation it receives for every Offering than an investor invests in.

In certain cases, the Issuer could pay to BRITE in whole or in part with its own securities (such as its own promissory note). This security will have to be the same class of security that the Issuer is offering to the Investors on the BRITE platform.

For instance, if the Issuer offers common stock to the Investors, only common stock could be used as a security for BRITE's compensation.

BRITE does not and will not have any financial interest in the Issuers listed on its crowdfunding platform, except the Securities it receives from the Issuers as compensation.

Following the completion of an Offering, BRITE may or may not continue to have an ongoing relationship with the Issuer. The Issuer may decide to make use of BRITE's portal and services to raise funds in the future, or use services provided by any entities affiliated with BRITE and pay a compensation for such services.
