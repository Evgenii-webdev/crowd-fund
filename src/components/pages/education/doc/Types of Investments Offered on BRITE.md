# Types of Investments Offered on BRITE

Depending on the investment opportunity, the Issuer has an option to offer several types of securities in exchange for your investment. The most common types of securities that the Issuer may offer are equity, debt, revenue share, and SAFE agreements.

Before you invest, please read carefully about each type of security being offered for a particular investment because each type of security has its own specific features and associated risks.

### Common Stock

Common stock is a security that represents a portion of your direct ownership interest in a company, which can be offered as a stock in corporation, membership interest in a limited liability company, or limited partnership interest in a limited partnership.

As an owner, you will have the right to receive dividend distributions for any profit made by the company, and you are also entitled to share any appreciation in the value of the company.

However, there is associated risk: when the company runs into financial difficulties or even dissolves, the value of your interests (shares or stock) goes down. The holders of common stock of the company typically have the following fundamental rights:

- Vote on corporate matters such as election of Board of Directors
- Entitled to the net assets of the company
- Receive financial statements and other materials and information related to company performance
- Review the company's financial records
- Sue on behalf of the company to right a wrong committed against it

Common stock is the riskiest type of equity security. In the event of liquidation of the company, the owners of common stock will be the last ones to get paid after all the creditors. Therefore, before you invest, consider that you will be able make money only if and when the company succeeds.

Often, the common stock being offered by Issuers is illiquid and should be seen as a long-term investment. Depending on the terms of the offering, the Investor might have a small portion of voting power.

In addition to that, in the event when the Issuer decides to seek further investment rounds and sell additional shares, it will result in a dilution of prior Investor's interests, and, therefore, a corresponding decrease of voting rights with respect to the shares purchased.

Last but not least, there is also a risk of potential value decrease of the company that may result in the loss of some or all of your investment.

### Preferred Stock

When buying the preferred stock, the Investor has priority rights over common shareholders in relation to dividend payments and distribution of the assets of the company, which includes but is not limited to the following:

- Entitled to a priority right in dividend payments ahead of common stock shareholders
- Depending on the terms of the offering, dividend distribution is usually established as a specified percentage of the price of the preferred stock or as fixed dollar amount
- Might have other priority rights listed in the bylaws and certificate of incorporation of the company
- In the event of sale of default of the company, the holder of the preferred stocks will receive any unpaid dividends and repayment of the price of the preferred shares.

Most of the time, but not always, preferred stock is a non-voting stock. The Investor should carefully read the terms of the investment offering by the Issuer. Risks associated with buying the preferred stock are similar to common stock.

In the event of liquidation of the company, the holders of the preferred stocks are getting paid after all the creditors. There is no guarantee or assurance that there will be any money or assets left over after all debts are paid.

In the situation when a business chooses to initiate an IPO (Initial public offering) the preferred stock may be converted into a common stock. The Investor shall carefully read the terms of each offering to be aware when that occurs.

Lastly, the company might decrease in value, and therefore there is a risk associated of losing some or all of your investments.

### Convertible Notes

Convertible Notes is a type of investment that starts in a form of debt that converts into equity when the Issuer seeks additional investment rounds. This type of investment is most popular with fintech startups because it allows

Investors to loan money to the company and receive equity in forms of common stock upon the future round of financing when new investors decide to invest. The investors get an early return through the interest payments with the potential to become an equity shareholder. As with any investment instrument, convertible notes carry risk.

One of the downsides is that you will not know how much your investment is worth until you convert it to an equity, which may or may not occur. As a combination of debt and equity, these securities are subject to the same risks for both, debt offerings before the conversion and equity offerings after the conversion.

As with any other security offerings, there is no guarantee or assurance that you will receive a return on your investment and that there is a chance of losing some or all of your investment.

Therefore, before you invest please carefully review and understand terms of the convertible note.

### Debt (Promissory Note)

Debt securities (or promissory notes) represent a note where the company (the Issuer) promises to repay the Investor the original amount (principal) plus the interest at a specified rate over a specified time period.

Depending on the offering, these payments can be monthly, quarterly, or annually. The interest rate and duration vary for each Issuer. Unlike equity offerings, debt offerings are more predictable in terms of return of your investment on a constant basis.

Promissory notes do not give the Investors any ownership, voting or management rights. Instead, the Investor is a creditor and will be paid first in line before equity holders when things go bad and the company decides to dissolve.

However, as with other financial instruments, debt securities are essentially loans to the company and the major risks they carry involve possibility of Issuer to fail. If you consider investing in debt offerings, please carefully review the Issuer's materials and understand specific risks involved.

### Corporate Bond

Corporate bond is an interest-bearing debt obligation. When you buy a corporate bond, you are lending money in return for a company's promise to pay a fixed sum of money (yield) at a specific maturity date in the future.

The company will pay interest on the principal before the maturity date is due. In contrast to purchasing equity, corporate bonds do not represent any ownership of the company.

You will only receive the interest and principal on the bond, regardless how well the company performs. On the other hand, the upside is that holders of corporate bonds have priorities over equity or debt instruments in corporation.

If the company runs into financial problems, it still has a legal obligation to make timely payments of interest and principal to its bond holders. However, like other investment instruments, corporate bonds also carry risks.

For example, the company may fail to make on time payments or in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation, there is no assurance that Issuers will have any assets to pay bond holders, therefore, they might lose their entire investment. The company's ability to pay its obligation in a timely way is an important risk factor to consider.

### Revenue Sharing Notes

Revenue sharing notes require the Issuer to make a specified percentage of the future generated gross revenue.

Generally, a revenue sharing note will specify the percentage of interest over the specified time period and state the maximum that Investor is entitled to receive and the due date for repayment of the principal amount.

For example, in return for your capital investment of $50,000, Issuer offers to give an Investor 10% of the future gross revenue until the business has paid the Investor 2 times the amount invested or $100,000 (2 x $50,000 = $100,000).

Same as other investments, revenue sharing notes have risks associated with the overall company performance. If the company has insufficient revenue or defaults on payments, the Investor may lose their entire investment.

### SAFE Agreements (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)

SAFE or Simple Agreement for Future Equity is an agreement between Issuer and Investor, where the company promises to grant an Investor an equity stake in the company at a future time if certain events occur.

SAFE is designed specifically for startups raising funds under Regulation Crowdfunding. However, SAFE agreements are different and vary from offering to offering. Please note that SAFE agreements are not a loan, read carefully the terms of a specific offering pertaining to future equity stake.

Despite its name, SAFE is neither simple, nor safe. It is important to recognize the following aspects about SAFEs:

- SAFE agreements are not stock; therefore, you are not getting equity stake in exchange for your investment
- SAFE agreements have different terms and provisions, such as conversion rights, repurchase rights, dissolution rights, and voting rights depending on specifics of the offering
- SAFE agreements may convert to equity if certain events occur. However, depending on the terms, it might not be triggered at all. Therefore, there is no guarantee of a return of your investment and that Investor can lose their investments.

For additional information, please review the SEC's ["Investor Bulletin: Be Cautious of SAFEs in Crowdfunding"](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_safes).

### SAFE+REV (Simple Agreement for Future Equity AND Revenue Participation Rights)

In addition to the above-mentioned description of SAFE agreements, this type of security also offers Investors the opportunity to share the future company's profits as a percentage of future gross revenues, capped at a certain multiple return.

However, there is no assurance that the company will have revenue to pay holders of revenue participation rights. In the event the company runs into financial difficulties the Investors may lose all their investments. Therefore, such risks should be considered before you decide to invest.
