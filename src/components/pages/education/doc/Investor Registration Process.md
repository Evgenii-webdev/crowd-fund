### Charges and Fees

As mentioned above there will be **NO FEES** to Investors. However, there are few different fees that BRITE will charge every company or individual representing an Offering:

- _Offering listing fee:_ $3,000 will be charged as an upfront fee which would be credited towards the final successful performance fee when the offering has met its minimum fundraising amount and raised funds are getting disbursed to the Issuer
- _Offering successful performance fee:_ This fee will be paid by the Issuer directly to BRITE based on the agreement between the Issuer and BRITE when the offering successfully met its established funding goal(s). This fee varies from offering to offering but will be disclosed to all Investors and will be included with the materials presented for each offering.

Depending on the type of the offering, successful performance fee could be in the form of a lump sum of cash payment or a combination of cash plus securities being offered, typically not exceeding more than 10% of the amount raised through BRITE platform.
