### The DO's and DON'Ts of BRITE

As a registered funding portal regulated by SEC, BRITE platform is a marketplace that acts as an intermediary between the Issuer and Investor. The Issuer is the company that was selected to raise capital using BRITE platform.

Therefore, when you make your investment, you do not invest in BRITE or any of BRITE's affiliates. You invest in the company (Issuer) that offers and sells their securities through our platform. We do not have any financial interest in that company other than a fee paid as a compensation for our services.

BRITE will facilitate transactions between an Issuer and Investor and perform the following activities to:

- Evaluate and select Issuer to list on our platform to raise funds by conducting the following:
- Perform all the required background checks on the executive team and company leaders in order to complete verification process
- Exercise due diligence to establish a reasonable basis for believing that an Issuer is in compliance with the statutory requirements for a security offering under Regulation Crowdfunding, as well as all applicable federal and state laws
- Determine a reasonable basis for believing that Issuer keeps accurate records of ownership of its securities
- Consult about their offerings and provide guidance on how to prepare all necessary offering documentation
- Make information (that an Issuer is required to disclose) available to the public on BRITE platform throughout the offering period and for a minimum of 21 days before any security may be sold in the offering
- Provide access to Investors to the most current educational materials and resources to help with risk assessment (e.g. this document)
- Require an Investor questionnaire demonstrating their full understanding of risk implications, securities resale restrictions, and investment cancellation policy
- Conduct due diligence to establish a reasonable basis of believing that the Investor complies with his/her investment limitation
- Provide communication channels between the Investors and the Issuer for interactions, discussions, questions, comments, etc.
- Deliver confirmation notices at or before completion of an investment commitment transaction
- Disclose to Investors the compensation BRITE receives for its services

To comply with federal laws and regulations BRITE is restricted from engaging in the following activities and **DOES NOT** :

- Provide or offer any investment advice or recommendations
- Solicit any purchases, sales or offers to buy the securities
- Hold, manage, possess, or handle Investor's funds or securities
- Promise or guarantee any particular investment outcomes and, therefore, cannot be held responsible if you lose your money invested
- Guarantee any accuracy of the information provided by the Issuers
- Compensate promoters, such as employees, agents, or other persons for solicitation or based on the sale of securities
- Allow any company (Issuer) to list any securities offerings that we have a reasonable basis for believing that an Issuer or the offering presents the potential for fraud or raises any other concerns related to investor protection
- Reward or compensate any person for providing personally identifiable information of any investor or potential investor
- Communicate to Investors any particular securities offering or company

### Before You Start: First Things First

Regulation Crowdfunding allows any person to invest in private companies. Although it might seem similar to a traditional public stock market, the process of investing in offerings listed on the BRITE platform is different.

In some cases, the company offering securities can be a small startup with no past performance records or historical data, be in development stage having limited or no revenue streams. Therefore, before you decide to make an investment, below is a list of additional elements to consider:

- There is always a chance that you may lose ALL your money invested, and therefore you should be in a financial condition to bear the losses
- You understand the company's business model, their products and services being proposed, the market and industry the company is operating in
- You understand the type of security being offered in return of your investment, time implications such as lock-in period (if any), process of dividends distribution (if any)
- You acknowledge all the risks associated with this type of investment and that all investments are made at your own risk
- You reviewed and understood all documents required for you to sign
- You have consulted with your financial advisors to help you evaluate if such investment is a good fit with your portfolio

Although, all the projects selected and approved by BRITE team for public offering are potentially good opportunities, but only when **YOU** feel comfortable with all these statements mentioned above is it appropriate for you to invest in any of them.
