# Investor Limitations

In general, any individual is free to invest in any offering. But Title III (related to Regulation Crowdfunding) of the Securities Law imposes limits on what amount can be invested by an Investor (including deemed "accredited investor") in a single Issuer in one year.

The limits on investment are application not just to one Issuer (or Company) or one crowdfunding platform (like BRITE), but to all Issuers and all crowdfunding platforms.

### Specific Investment Limits

During a 12-month period, you (the Investor) are allowed to invest a maximum aggregate amount in all offerings under Title III as follows:

- If either your net worth or your annual income is below $107,000, you can invest up to 5 percent of this amount (whichever is lesser). Or, you can invest up to $2,200 if that figure is higher than the former amount.
- If both your net worth and your annual income are $107,000 each or higher, then you can invest up to 10 percent of the either figure. The investment amount in any case cannot exceed $107,000.

| Annual Income | Net Worth | Calculation | 12-month Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $30,000 | $105,000 | greater of $2,200 or 5% of $30,000 ($1,500) | $2,200 |
| $150,000 | $80,000 | greater of $2,200 or 5% of $80,000 ($4,000) | $4,000 |
| $150,000 | $107,000 | 10% of $107,000 ($10,700) | $10,700 |
| $200,000 | $900,000 | 10% of $200,000 ($20,000) | $20,000 |
| $1.2 million | $2 million | 10% of $1.2 million ($120,000), subject to cap | $107,000 |

An Issuer that sells or offers securities under Title III may depend on the efforts of BRITE platform to ensure that an Investor does not exceed the aforementioned limits, under the following three conditions:

1. The Issuer has no prior information that the Investor has or would exceed the legal investment limits if they buy securities from the Issuer.
2. The transaction is executed solely through the BRITE platform, while the platform is in compliance of the Regulation Crowdfunding requirements.
3. The Issuer does not carry out an offering using multiple crowdfunding platforms.

Investors should also note that their net worth and annual income may be computed jointly with their spouse. When such a joint computation is applied, the combined investment amount should not exceed the limits that are applicable to an individual investor who is at the same net worth or annual income level.

These investment limits are applicable to all Investors on BRITE, including any "accredited investors." Due to inflation and other economic factors, the SEC may periodically adjust these investment limits.

**EXAMPLE:**

Investor John has a net worth of $150,000 and an annual income of $107,000. Investor John invests $7,500 in Company A on December 1st, 2017 under Title III on BRITE platform. On November 27th, 2018, Investor John wants to invest a second amount of $5,000 in Company B.

However, he is only allowed to invest $3,200 in Company B. ($7,500 + $3,200 = $10,700 or 10% of $107,000)

That's because his maximum investment limit is 10% of his annual income or net worth (whichever is lower).

However, this limit is applicable only for 12 months.

So, next year, starting December 1st, 2018, he can again invest up to $10,700 through BRITE.

### Who is an Accredited Investor?

The law defines an "accredited investor" as:

- A natural person whose net worth, individually or jointly with spouse is in excess of $1 million (excluding the value of primary residence) at the time of the transaction.
- A natural person whose income is in excess of $200,000 per annum for two most recent years consecutively, or whose joint income with spouse is in excess of $300,000 for that same period, along with a reasonable expectation to maintain the same income level in the current year.
- A trust whose assets exceed $5 million; which is not created just for the purpose of buying the offered securities; and whose purchase is overseen by a knowledgeable (or sophisticated) person.
- A business where every equity holder is an accredited investor.
- An employee benefit plan where the investment decisions are made by an insurer, banker, or a registered investment advisor, or if the plan's total assets exceed $5 million.
- An insurance company, bank, a business development company, registered investment company, or a small business investment company.
- A corporation, charity, or partnership with assets in excess of $5 million, which has not been created just for the purpose of buying the offered securities.
- A general partner, executive officer or director of the Company or the Issuer offering the securities.

### Calculation of Net Worth

Net worth is computed by deducting all the liabilities from all the assets. The value of your primary resident is excluded from this calculation for the purpose of Regulation Crowdfunding.

In addition, any loan or mortgage on your home is not counted as a liability (but only up to the home's fair market value). If the loan exceeds the home's fair market value, then the excess amount will count as a liability for the purpose of net worth calculation.

Furthermore, if within 60 days before the securities purchase transaction, there is an increase in your loan amount (regardless of whether the loan amount exceeds the value of home or doesn't), that amount will be counted as part of the liabilities.

In a nutshell, your net worth is what you own minus what you owe. To determine your precise net worth, you may use a reliable online calculator[LINK], but also seek professional advice from a financial consultant.

### Investor Requirements and Acknowledgments

Prior to your committing to an investment via BRITE platform, you are required to fulfill a legal obligation of providing us with an acknowledgment (by way of filling out an Investor Questionnaire). This acknowledgment will represent that you have read and understood the Crowdfunding Investor Guidelines, Risks, and other Educational Materials that we have provided on our platform.

For every additional investment that you may want to make via BRITE, you will have to provide this signed acknowledgment (or filled-out Investor Questionnaire) each time.

Each Questionnaire will require the latest relevant information confirming that you are eligible to invest through BRITE. You will also be required to provide information about any amounts you may have invested through other crowdfunding platforms during the previous 12 months.

The Questionnaire will be accessible online through BRITE platform.

### Making an Investment

Following your compliance with the above-described mandatory requirements, you will be required to notify us about the specific amount you wish to invest in a particular Offering. We will then direct you to send the funds or a commitment to a designated Escrow Agent.

#### _Notice of Investment Commitment_

BRITE platform will also issue you a Notice of:

- The amount of payment or investment commitment
- The name of the Issuer
- The price of the securities
- The time and date until when you are eligible for investment cancellation.

### Target Offering Amount and Offering Deadline

The Issuer (or the Company) will disclose a "target offering amount" for each offering. This refers to the minimum amount the Issuer aims to raise by a specific deadline ("offering deadline").

If the Issuer fails to raise the target offering amount by the offering deadline, the offering will be automatically cancelled. If you (the Investor) have already made a payment or an investment commitment by then, your money will be returned to you.

If the target offering amount is reached before the offering deadline, the Issuer may choose to close the offering early, as long as the following conditions are fulfilled:

1. The offering was open for 21 days or more
2. The investors received a Notice from BRITE

This notice must:

- Inform the new deadline (this must be at least 5 days from the date of Notice)
- Inform the investors that they can choose investment cancellation up to 48 hours before the new deadline
- Inform the investors if the Issuer plans to continue accepting investment commitments during the 48-hour period before the new deadline

In a situation where an Issuer decides to accept investment commitments above the target offering amount, they must inform the maximum investment amount they will accept, and how they plan to handle the excess investment amount ("over-subscription" to their issue). For instance, the Issuer may allocate the securities on a pro rata or first-come-first-served basis to the investors, or in some other manner.

### Paying for Your Investment

All prospective Investors and Issuers should note that BRITE will use North Capital Trust Company for Escrow services.

As an Investor, you can make payment for your securities purchased using one of the payment options listed on the BRITE platform. These options may include direct bank transfer, wire transfer, and credit card payments. A convenience fee might be levied if you pay through a credit card.

Your payment via BRITE platform will be held in an escrow account administered by North Capital Trust Company (which is a qualified third party) until the completion of the Offering.

BRITE, as a crowdfunding platform, is not legally allowed to hold your money. If the Issuer successfully raises the target offering amount, your payment from the escrow account will be released to them. BRITE will notify you of this transaction via email. This will complete the investment process.

### Confirmation of Your Transaction

Before your investment through BRITE gets finalized, you will receive a Notice from us, which will inform, among other things:

- Transaction date
- Security type
- Number and price of the securities you are purchasing
- Total number of securities the Issuer has sold and the price(s) at which they were sold
- If you have invested in a debt security, the rate of interest and the maturity yield calculated from the maturity date and the price paid
- If you have invested in a callable security, the first date when the Issuer can call the security
- The amount, form and source of any compensation that BRITE, as your crowdfunding intermediary, expects to earn from this transaction.
