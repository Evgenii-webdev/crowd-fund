# Securities Transfer and Resale Limitations

Once you invest and buy a security, typically, you will not be allowed to sell or transfer it for at least 12 months, except when the securities are transferred:

- Back to the Issuer
- To an accredited investor
- As a part of an offering registered with SEC
- To a family member, to a trust controlled by the Investor, to a trust created for the benefit of Investor's family member, or in connection with death or divorce of Investor.

Note: The term "family member" includes a child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse or spousal equivalent, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law of the purchaser, and includes adoptive relationships.

The term "spousal equivalent" means a cohabitant occupying a relationship generally equivalent to that of a spouse.

In addition to the one-year restriction period, you should consider that there might not be a secondary market available to sell or liquidate your securities. Therefore, the Investor should be aware of the risks of holding specific securities for uncertain period of time.
